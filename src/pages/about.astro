      <H>about me</H>
      <p class="mb-8">
        I'm a student from Las Vegas, Nevada who's been interested in computers
        and technology all my life, as well as music, camping, soccer, and
        games.
        <br />
        I am currently attending Oregon State University getting a degree in Electrical
        and Computer Engineering.
        <br />
        In my free time I like to listen to music (Radiohead fanboy), play guitar,
        watch movies (go see Baby Driver), and play video games.

      <H>this site</H>
      <p>
        This site is mainly to be used as a personal portfolio and a place to
        <Link url="/blog">write about my experiences</Link> with life and technology.
        <br />
        Big inspiration for this site came from
        <Link url="https://basicappleguy.com">Basic Apple Guy</Link>,
        <Link url="https://jamesbvaughan.com">James Vaughan</Link>, and
        <Link url="https://cobalt.tools">cobalt</Link>. The typing effect on the
        home screen was ripped directly from
        <Link url="https://bun.sh">Bun's homepage</Link>.
        <br />
        I plan on writing a blog post further down the line detailing more about
        the technology behind this site.
